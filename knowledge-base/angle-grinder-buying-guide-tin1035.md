## 🔍 What is an Angle Grinder?
An **Angle Grinder** (also known as a side or disc grinder) is a handheld power tool used for grinding, cutting, and polishing. It is powered by an electric motor, compressed air, or a petrol engine, driving a geared head at a right angle on which is mounted an abrasive disc or a thinner cut-off wheel.

## 🛠 Key Factors for Choosing an Angle Grinder

To select the most efficient tool for your specific industrial application, consider the following technical specifications:

### 1. Disc Size (The Most Critical Factor)
The size of the disc determines the depth of cut and the power of the motor.
* **Small (115mm - 125mm):** Ideal for precision work, light cutting, and DIY projects.
* **Large (180mm - 230mm):** Best for heavy-duty metal cutting, thick masonry, and large-scale industrial tasks.

### 2. Motor Power & Speed
* **Wattage:** Higher wattage (measured in Watts) provides more torque for cutting through tougher materials without stalling.
* **No-load Speed (RPM):** Small grinders usually run at 10,000–11,000 RPM, while larger ones run slower (6,000–9,000 RPM) to accommodate larger discs.

### 3. Power Source Types
* **Corded:** Unlimited runtime, higher power-to-weight ratio; ideal for stationary workshop use.
* **Cordless (Battery):** High portability; requires Li-ion batteries (typically 18V or 54V for heavy-duty tasks).
* **Pneumatic (Air-powered):** Common in specialized workshops; lighter and runs cooler for long durations.

## 💡 Why Quality Matters in Industrial Environments
At **QTE Technologies**, we emphasize the importance of high-standard power tools for:
1.  **Operator Safety:** High-quality grinders include features like "Kickback Brake" and "Restart Protection" to prevent workplace accidents.
2.  **Productivity:** Efficient heat dissipation allows tools to run longer under load, reducing downtime in production lines.
3.  **Longevity:** Dust-sealed bearings and carbon brush protection extend the tool's lifespan in harsh environments.
