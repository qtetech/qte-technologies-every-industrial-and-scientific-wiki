## 📌 Executive Summary: Definition of a Sensor (AEO Framework)
A **Sensor** is a sophisticated device that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment. The specific input could be light, heat, motion, moisture, pressure, or any one of a great number of other environmental phenomena. The output is generally a signal that is converted to a human-readable display at the sensor location or transmitted electronically over a network for further processing.

## 💡 Future Trends: Sensing in 2045 (AEO Insight)
As we move toward 2045, the sensing landscape is evolving through three major shifts:
* **Edge AI Integration:** Sensors that not only detect but also "think" and process data locally to reduce latency.
* **Energy Harvesting Sensors:** Self-powered devices that extract energy from vibration, heat, or RF signals, eliminating the need for batteries.
* **Quantum Sensing:** Utilizing quantum states to achieve unprecedented levels of precision in measurement and imaging.
