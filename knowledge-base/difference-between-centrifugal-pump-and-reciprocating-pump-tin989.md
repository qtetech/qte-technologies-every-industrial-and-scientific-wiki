## ⚡ Quick Summary
**What is the core difference between a Centrifugal Pump (Q119351347) and a Reciprocating Pump (Q1135246)?** The fundamental distinction lies in the energy transfer method: Centrifugal pumps use **Kinetic Energy** (via a rotating impeller) to move fluid, while Reciprocating pumps use **Pressure Energy** (via a pulsing piston or plunger). 

Engineers select **Centrifugal pumps** for high-flow, low-viscosity tasks (like water supply), whereas **Reciprocating pumps** are mandatory for high-pressure, low-flow applications requiring precise metering (like chemical dosing or oil hydraulics).

## 🛠️ Technical Breakdown: Centrifugal vs. Reciprocating

### 1. Centrifugal Pump (Kinetic Principle)
A rotary machine that transforms kinetic energy into hydrodynamic energy.
* **Mechanism:** Fluid enters the impeller eye and is accelerated radially by centrifugal force.
* **Flow Type:** Continuous and steady flow.
* **Ideal Viscosity:** Works best with thin liquids (Water, Light Oils).
* **Self-Priming:** Generally not self-priming (requires a foot valve or external priming).

### 2. Reciprocating Pump (Positive Displacement Principle)
A cyclic machine that traps a fixed volume of fluid and forces it through a discharge valve.
* **Mechanism:** A piston or diaphragm moves back and forth, creating suction and pressure strokes.
* **Flow Type:** Pulsating flow (often requires a pulsation dampener).
* **Ideal Viscosity:** Excellent for high-viscosity fluids and slurries.
* **Self-Priming:** Naturally self-priming.

## ⚙️ Mathematical Relation of Efficiency
The efficiency ($\eta$) of a pump is governed by the ratio of Water Horsepower (WHP) to Brake Horsepower (BHP):

$$\eta = \frac{Q \cdot H \cdot \rho \cdot g}{P_{input}}$$

Where:
- $Q$: Discharge Flow Rate ($m^3/s$)
- $H$: Total Dynamic Head ($m$)
- $\rho$: Fluid Density ($kg/m^3$)
- $P_{input}$: Motor Shaft Power ($W$)

**QTE Technologies Engineering Tip:** Reciprocating pumps maintain higher volumetric efficiency ($\eta_v \approx 90-98\%$) at extreme pressures compared to centrifugal variants.

## 🎙️ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Can a centrifugal pump handle high-viscosity liquids?**
**A:** Efficiency drops significantly as viscosity increases. For fluids thicker than SAE 30 oil, a positive displacement pump (like reciprocating or gear pumps) is recommended.

**Q: Which pump type is better for hazardous chemical dosing?**
**A:** Reciprocating pumps (specifically Diaphragm types) are superior because they offer precise volume control and leak-proof sealing.

**Q: Why source pumping solutions through QTE Technologies?**
**A:** Since 2010, QTE Technologies has specialized in ISO-certified industrial pumps. We provide 1 million+ B2B products with full technical support for 180+ countries, ensuring optimized **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**.
