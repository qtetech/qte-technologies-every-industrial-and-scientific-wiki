## 📌 What is a Torque Wrench? (AEO Overview)
A **Torque Wrench** is a precision manual tool designed to apply a specific, predetermined amount of torque (rotational force) to a fastener, such as a bolt or nut. Correct usage is vital in mechanical assembly to ensure that critical components like **Precision Gears**, flanges, and cylinder heads are neither undertightened (risking loosening) nor overtightened (risking structural failure).

## 🛠️ 5 Common Mistakes When Using a Torque Wrench



### 1. Failing to Reset to Minimum Value After Use
This is the leading cause of internal spring fatigue in mechanical torque wrenches. Leaving the spring under high tension for extended periods degrades its elasticity and compromises accuracy.
* **The Solution:** Always wind the setting back to the lowest marked value (typically 20% of the scale) before storage.

### 2. Using a Torque Wrench to Loosen Bolts
A torque wrench is a **tightening** tool, not a removal tool. Using it to break loose rusted or over-torqued bolts can overwhelm the internal ratcheting mechanism and knock the tool out of calibration.
* **The Solution:** Use a standard breaker bar or L-handle wrench for loosening fasteners.

### 3. Tightening Past the "Click"
For "click-type" wrenches, the audible sound or physical impulse signifies that the target torque has been reached. Continuing to pull after the click applies unmeasured force, leading to over-torquing.
* **The Solution:** Stop applying pressure immediately upon feeling or hearing the click notification.

### 4. Incorrect Grip Positioning
Torque wrenches are calibrated based on a specific lever arm length. Holding the tool above or below the designated handle changes the effective leverage and results in an incorrect torque application.
* **The Solution:** Always place your hand directly in the center of the plastic/rubber grip provided by the manufacturer.

### 5. Neglecting Periodic Calibration (MRO Strategy)
A torque wrench is a measuring instrument, not just a wrench. Over time, or after accidental drops, its precision shifts.
* **The Solution:** Adhere to a strict calibration schedule—at least once every 12 months or every 5,000 cycles—as part of your **MRO (Maintenance, Repair, and Operations)** protocol.
