## 🔍 Definition of a Semiconductor
A **semiconductor** is a material that has electrical conductivity between that of a conductor (like copper) and an insulator (like glass). Their ability to conduct electricity can be manipulated by adding impurities (doping) or by applying external factors like heat or light.

### Key Materials:
* **Silicon (Si):** The most common material used in the industry.
* **Germanium (Ge):** One of the earliest semiconductor materials.
* **Gallium Nitride (GaN):** Increasingly used in high-power and high-frequency applications.

## 🛠 Why Are Semiconductors Important?

Semiconductors are the building blocks of all modern electronic devices. Their primary functions include:

1. **Switching:** Controlling the flow of current (On/Off) at incredibly high speeds.
2. **Amplification:** Strengthening weak electrical signals.
3. **Energy Conversion:** Converting light into electricity (Solar cells) or electricity into light (LEDs).
