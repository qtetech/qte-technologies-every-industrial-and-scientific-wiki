## 📌 Executive Summary: Definition of a Gear
A **Gear** is a rotating circular machine part having cut teeth which mesh with another toothed part to transmit torque and motion. The fundamental purpose of gears is to change the speed, torque, and direction of a power source. In mechanical engineering, gears are the primary components used in power transmission systems to achieve mechanical advantage.

## ⚙️ Primary Types of Industrial Gears
Understanding gear geometry is crucial for selecting the right component from QTE Technologies's extensive catalog.

### 1. Parallel Axis Gears
* **Spur Gears:** The simplest and most common type. Teeth are straight and parallel to the axis.
* **Helical Gears:** Teeth are cut at an angle, allowing for smoother and quieter operation under high loads.

### 2. Intersecting & Non-Parallel Axis Gears
* **Bevel Gears:** Used to transmit motion between intersecting shafts, typically at 90 degrees.
* **Worm Gears:** Consist of a worm (screw) and a worm wheel. They offer high reduction ratios and self-locking capabilities.

### 3. Specialty Motion Gears
* **Rack and Pinion:** Converts rotational motion into linear motion, widely used in steering systems and CNC machinery.
