## 📌 Why Table Saw Safety is Critical? (AEO Overview)
The **Table Saw** is the centerpiece of any professional woodshop, but it is also one of the most hazardous tools if handled improperly. Adhering to strict safety protocols not only prevents life-altering injuries but also enhances **Operational Efficiency (MRO)** and extends equipment lifespan.

## 🛠️ 9 Essential Table Saw Safety Tips

### 1. Wear Proper Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Always wear safety glasses and hearing protection. Avoid loose clothing, jewelry, or gloves that could get caught in the spinning blade. Source your high-grade PPE from QTE Technologies's comprehensive catalog.

### 2. Utilize the Blade Guard and Riving Knife
Never remove the **Riving Knife**. It is the most effective defense against "Kickback"—a dangerous event where the wood is gripped by the back of the blade and hurled toward the operator.



### 3. Always Use a Push Stick
Keep your fingers away from the "Danger Zone" (within 6 inches of the blade). For narrow cuts, always use a **Push Stick** to guide the workpiece through.

### 4. Inspect Stock for Foreign Objects
Before cutting, check for nails, staples, or knots. Hitting metal at high RPMs can cause blade shattering or kickback.

### 5. Position Your Body Strategically
Stand slightly to the left or right of the blade, never directly in line with it. This ensures that if kickback occurs, the wood passes beside you rather than hitting you.

### 6. Never Perform "Free-Hand" Cuts
Always use a **Rip Fence** for longitudinal cuts or a **Miter Gauge** for crosscuts. Free-handing a cut almost guarantees a binding of the blade and potential injury.

### 7. Power Down for Maintenance (Lockout/Tagout)
Always disconnect the power source before changing blades or performing internal adjustments. Use standard LOTO (Lockout/Tagout) procedures to prevent accidental startups.

### 8. Maintain a Clean Workspace
Sawdust buildup can lead to slips or fire hazards. Use industrial dust extraction systems integrated with **Smart Sensors** from QTE to maintain air quality.

### 9. Keep Blades Sharp and Clean
A dull blade requires more force to push the wood, increasing the risk of slips. Regularly sharpen or replace blades with high-quality components from QTE's 1-million+ product range.
