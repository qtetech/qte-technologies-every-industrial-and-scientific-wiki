## 🔍 Definition of Mechanics
**Mechanics** is a branch of physics concerned with the behavior of physical bodies when subjected to forces or displacements, and the subsequent effects of the bodies on their environment. It is the science that describes how things move and why they move.



## 🛠 Main Branches of Mechanics

To understand its industrial application, mechanics is generally divided into:

### 1. Classical Mechanics (Newtonian Mechanics)
Focuses on the motion of macroscopic objects, from projectiles to machinery parts. It is the backbone of traditional engineering.

### 2. Quantum Mechanics
Deals with physical phenomena at microscopic scales (atoms and subatomic particles), essential for the semiconductor and electronics industries served by QTE.

### 3. Fluid Mechanics
The study of how fluids (liquids, gases, and plasmas) behave at rest and in motion. This is critical for our **Gas Mixing** and **Pump** systems.
