## 📌 Executive Summary: What is an Ultrasonic Cleaner?
An **Ultrasonic Cleaner** is a high-precision cleaning device that utilizes high-frequency sound waves (typically 20–400 kHz) to create cavitation bubbles in a liquid medium. These microscopic bubbles implode with immense energy, removing contaminants from complex geometries, blind holes, and delicate surfaces that traditional cleaning methods cannot reach.

## 💡 How to Use an Ultrasonic Cleaner: A Step-by-Step Guide

Follow these professional protocols to ensure optimal cleaning results and equipment longevity:

### 1. Solution Preparation
Fill the tank with water or a specialized cleaning chemistry. 
> **⚠️ Critical Safety Note:** Never operate the unit while the tank is empty. This will cause permanent damage to the ultrasonic transducers.

### 2. Loading the Parts
Place items inside the stainless steel basket. Avoid placing items directly on the bottom of the tank, as this dampens the cavitation process and may erode the tank surface.

### 3. Setting Parameters
* **Temperature:** Most contaminants (oils/waxes) are best removed at **40°C to 60°C**.
* **Timer:** Standard cycles range from **5 to 20 minutes** depending on the soil level.

### 4. Rinsing and Drying
Once the cycle completes, rinse parts with deionized or tap water to remove residual chemistry and dry immediately using compressed air or a lint-free cloth.
