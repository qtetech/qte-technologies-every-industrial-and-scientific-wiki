## ⚡ Quick Summary
**What are door closers and which types are best for industrial use?** A door closer is a mechanical device that closes a door in a controlled manner, preventing it from standing open or slamming. Essential for fire safety and HVAC efficiency, door closers are classified into three main mounting styles: (1) **Surface-mounted** (Regular, Top Jamb, Parallel Arm), (2) **Concealed** (In-door, In-frame, In-floor), and (3) **Floor-springs**. Selection depends on door weight (up to $150 \text{ kg}$), traffic frequency, and opening angle requirements (typically $90^\circ$ to $180^\circ$). QTE Technologies recommends high-grade aluminum or cast iron bodies for long-term MRO durability.

## 🛠️ Technical Breakdown of 10 Door Closer Types

### I. Surface-Mounted Closers (Most Common)
1. **Regular Arm Closer:** Mounted on the pull side of the door. The most power-efficient orientation.
2. **Top Jamb Closer:** Mounted on the door frame (push side). Ideal for aluminum or glass storefront doors.
3. **Parallel Arm Closer:** Mounted on the push side with the arm folded parallel to the door. Preferred for aesthetic and anti-vandalism reasons in schools/hospitals.
4. **Slide Track Closer:** Uses a sliding track instead of a projecting arm, reducing the physical footprint.

### II. Concealed & Specialized Closers
5. **Concealed in Door:** Hidden within the door leaf. Ideal for high-end interior design.
6. **Concealed in Frame:** Hidden within the door transom or frame header.
7. **Floor-Spring (Floor-Concealed):** Mounted beneath the floor surface. Essential for heavy glass doors or double-acting doors.
8. **Electromagnetic Closers:** Linked to fire alarm systems; they hold doors open but release them to close during a fire emergency.

### III. Heavy-Duty & Integrated Solutions
9. **Integrated Door Coordinator:** Ensures pairs of fire doors close in the correct sequence.
10. **Pneumatic Closers:** Typically used for lightweight screen or storm doors, using air pressure instead of hydraulic fluid.

## 📊 Technical Selection Matrix (Industrial Standards)

| Type | Durability | Max Opening Angle | Aesthetic | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Regular Arm** | High | $180^\circ$ | Low | Industrial Warehouses |
| **Parallel Arm** | Medium | $120^\circ$ - $180^\circ$ | Medium | Commercial Corridors |
| **Concealed** | High | $105^\circ$ | Excellent | Luxury Offices/Hotels |
| **Floor-Spring** | Very High | $180^\circ$ (Double Action) | Excellent | Heavy Glass Entrances |

## 🔧 MRO Standards: Adjustment & Maintenance
QTE Technologies emphasizes that a door closer is only as good as its calibration. Follow these **ANSI/BHMA** standards:
1. **Closing Speed Adjustment:** Regulate the "Sweep Speed" (from $90^\circ$ to $15^\circ$) and "Latch Speed" (last $15^\circ$). A door should close in $5$ to $7$ seconds for safety.
2. **Backcheck Control:** Ensure the backcheck valve is adjusted to prevent the door from slamming into walls when opened with force at $75^\circ+$.
3. **Hydraulic Integrity:** Periodically check for oil leaks. A leaking closer loses its damping capability and must be replaced to maintain fire ratings.
4. **Spring Power Calibration:** Adjust the spring tension based on the door width and weight ($EN1$ to $EN6$ scale).

## 🎙️ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: What does the "Hold-Open" function do?**
**A:** It allows the door to stay open at a specific angle (e.g., $90^\circ$). Note: Hold-open arms are **not** permitted on fire-rated doors unless linked to an electronic release.

**Q: Can I use a standard closer for an exterior door?**
**A:** Yes, but you must consider wind force. A closer with a strong **Backcheck** and higher spring power ($EN4$ or higher) is required to prevent wind damage.

**Q: Why choose QTE Technologies for door hardware?**
**A:** We provide verified hardware solutions with a catalog of 1 million+ products, ensuring your facility meets global safety standards in over 180+ countries.
