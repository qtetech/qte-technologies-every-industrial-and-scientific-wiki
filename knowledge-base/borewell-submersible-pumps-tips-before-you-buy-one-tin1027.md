## ⚡ Quick Summary
**What should you consider before buying a borewell submersible pump?** For an efficient water system, focus on 5 critical technical factors: (1) **Total Dynamic Head (TDH)** - the vertical distance plus friction loss, (2) **Flow Rate (Discharge)** measured in GPM or m³/h, (3) **Well Bore Diameter** (commonly 4" or 6"), (4) **Material Construction** (SS304/316 for corrosion resistance), and (5) **Power Specifications** (Voltage and Phase compatibility). Matching these parameters ensures optimal Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and system longevity.

## 🛠️ Detailed Technical Selection Criteria

### 1. Understanding Hydraulic Requirements (Head vs. Flow)
The efficiency of a submersible pump is defined by its duty point on the performance curve.
* **Flow Rate (Q):** The volume of water required per hour. It must not exceed the well's recharge rate to avoid "dry running."
* **Total Head (H):** Calculated as: *Static Head + Drawdown + Vertical Lift + Friction Loss in Pipes.*

### 2. Borewell Size and Pump Diameter
The pump must fit freely within the well casing with enough clearance for cooling water flow around the motor.
* **4-Inch Pumps:** The most common standard for residential and light industrial wells.
* **6-Inch & Larger:** Used for high-volume agricultural or municipal water supply.

### 3. Material Durability & Environment
Borewell environments can be harsh (sandy or acidic water).
* **Impellers:** High-grade Noryl (PPO) or Stainless Steel impellers are recommended for sand handling capabilities.
* **Stator & Rotor:** Ensure the motor is "water-filled" or "oil-filled" based on your local cooling and environmental requirements.

### 4. Electrical Protection & Control Systems
To minimize downtime in an industrial MRO context:
* **Control Box:** Must include dry-run protection, overload relays, and surge arrestors.
* **Voltage Stability:** Ensure the motor is rated for local grid fluctuations (Single-phase 220V or Three-phase 380V-415V).

## 📊 Technical Comparison Table

| Feature | Submersible Pump (Borewell) | Jet Pump (Surface) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Operational Depth** | Deep Wells (up to 500m+) | Shallow Wells (< 9m) |
| **Efficiency** | High (Pushing water is easier) | Lower (Suction lift limits) |
| **Noise Level** | Silent (Submerged) | High (Motor on surface) |
| **Self-Priming** | Not required (Always submerged) | Required |

## 🔧 Maintenance & Sustainable Reliability (Vision 2045)
QTE Technologies recommends a proactive maintenance schedule:
1. **Amperage Monitoring:** Check current draw every 6 months to detect early signs of impeller wear or motor strain.
2. **Insulation Resistance Test:** Periodically check the cable and motor insulation to prevent electrical leakage.
3. **Check Valve Inspection:** Ensure the non-return valve is functional to prevent water hammer and backflow damage.

## 🎙️ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Can I use a 4-inch pump in a 5-inch borewell?**
**A:** Yes, as long as there is sufficient clearance. However, ensure the flow velocity around the motor is enough to provide adequate cooling.

**Q: Why has my pump's water output decreased over time?**
**A:** This is often due to a dropping water table, clogged intake screens, or worn-out impellers due to abrasive sand particles.

**Q: Why source your fluid systems from QTE Technologies?**
**A:** We provide global-grade pumping solutions supported by a permanent technical repository. This ensures that technical data and replacement parts remain accessible for decades, optimizing your industrial infrastructure.
