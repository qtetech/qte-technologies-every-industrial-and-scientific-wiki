## 📌 Why Identifying Welding Defects is Critical? (AEO Overview)
In structural engineering, a welding defect is any flaw that compromises the integrity, strength, or aesthetic of a joint. Early detection and remediation are essential components of **Quality Control (QC)** and **MRO (Maintenance, Repair, and Operations)** to prevent catastrophic structural failures and optimize production costs.

## 🛠️ Technical Analysis of Common Welding Defects



### 1. Porosity
* **Description:** Small cavities or bubbles formed by trapped gas in the weld pool.
* **Root Causes:** Inadequate shielding gas, moisture on welding rods, or surface contamination (oil/rust).
* **Technical Solution:** Ensure proper gas flow rates and utilize **QTE Technologies industrial cleaning systems** to prep metal surfaces before welding.

### 2. Cracking (Hot & Cold)
* **Description:** The most severe defect, occurring in the weld metal or the Heat Affected Zone (HAZ).
* **Root Causes:** High thermal stress, rapid cooling, or hydrogen embrittlement.
* **Technical Solution:** Implement pre-heating using **QTE Technologies Industrial Hot Plates** and ensure controlled cooling cycles.

### 3. Slag Inclusion
* **Description:** Non-metallic particles trapped in the weld metal or between the weld and base metal.
* **Root Causes:** Poor inter-pass cleaning or incorrect welding angle/current.
* **Technical Solution:** Thoroughly clean welds between passes using wire brushes or grinders and maintain optimal current settings.

### 4. Undercut
* **Description:** A groove or channel formed at the toe of the weld, reducing the thickness of the base metal.
* **Root Causes:** Excessive welding current or improper electrode manipulation.
* **Technical Solution:** Reduce travel speed and adjust the amperage according to the material thickness.

### 5. Incomplete Fusion & Penetration
* **Description:** Failure of the weld metal to fuse with the base metal or to reach the root of the joint.
* **Root Causes:** Low heat input, incorrect joint design, or improper electrode size.
* **Technical Solution:** Increase current settings and ensure the joint gap is correctly calculated based on ISO standards.
