## 🔍 Core Definition
An **electronic component** is a basic discrete device or physical entity in an electronic system used to affect electrons or their associated fields. These components are the building blocks of all modern machinery, from gas analyzers to semiconductor systems.

## 🛠 Classification of Electronic Components

### 1. Passive Components
Components that cannot introduce net energy into the circuit.
* **Resistors:** Limit current flow.
* **Capacitors:** Store electrical energy in an electric field.
* **Inductors:** Store energy in a magnetic field.

### 2. Active Components
Components that rely on a source of power and can introduce power into a circuit.
* **Transistors:** Act as switches or amplifiers (Crucial for QTE's control systems).
* **Diodes:** Allow current to flow in one direction only.
* **Integrated Circuits (ICs):** Complex circuits on a small chip.

### 3. Electromechanical Components
Devices that use electrical signals to cause mechanical changes.
* **Relays, Switches, and Connectors.**
