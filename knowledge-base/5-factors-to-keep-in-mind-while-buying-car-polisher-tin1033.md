## ⚡ Quick Summary
**What should you consider when buying a car polisher?** For optimal paint correction and safety, focus on 5 core factors: (1) Movement Type (Dual Action vs. Rotary), (2) Power and Variable Speed (RPM/OPM), (3) Ergonomics and Weight, (4) Backing Plate Size, and (5) Vibration Control & Thermal Management. Selecting the right machine ensures paint longevity and optimizes Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).

## 🛠️ Detailed Analysis of the 5 Key Selection Factors

### 1. Movement Type (The Safety Foundation)
The mechanism of movement determines the aggressiveness and safety level on the clear coat.
* **Rotary Polishers:** Direct circular motion. High cutting power for deep scratches but generates high heat; requires expert handling to avoid paint burn.
* **Dual Action (DA) Polishers:** Orbits and rotates simultaneously. Extremely safe, prevents heat buildup, and is ideal for both beginners and pros to achieve a swirl-free finish.



### 2. Power and Variable Speed Control
Professional detailing requires precise speed adjustment for different stages of correction.
* **Low Speeds:** Best for spreading wax, sealant, or glazes.
* **High Speeds:** Necessary for compounding and removing heavy oxidation.
* **Pro Tip:** Look for "Soft Start" features to prevent slinging polishing compounds upon startup.

### 3. Ergonomics, Weight, and Vibration
Polishing a full vehicle is a labor-intensive task.
* **Weight:** Aim for 2.0kg - 2.8kg to provide enough downward pressure without causing operator fatigue.
* **Vibration Dampening:** High-quality rubber grips and balanced internal counterweights protect the technician's joints over long-term use (Industrial Safety Standards).

### 4. Backing Plate Size and Versatility
The 5-inch (125mm) plate is the global industry standard for versatility.
* **Interchangeability:** Ensure the polisher allows for plate swapping (e.g., down to 3-inch) to navigate tight curves, bumpers, and A-pillars effectively.

### 5. Cooling System and MRO Durability
In high-volume industrial environments, tool duty cycles are critical.
* **Thermal Management:** Look for strategically placed vents that direct hot air away from the operator.
* **Maintenance:** Prioritize machines with easy-access carbon brushes or modern **Brushless Motors** to minimize maintenance downtime and maximize TCO.

## 🎙️ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Which polisher is best for a beginner?**
**A:** A Dual Action (DA) Polisher is highly recommended for beginners due to its random orbital motion, which significantly reduces the risk of burning through the paint or creating holograms.

**Q: Why source from an MRO provider like QTE Technologies?**
**A:** QTE Technologies ensures all equipment meets global industrial standards, backed by a robust supply chain of genuine replacement parts and expert technical support for long-term operational reliability.
