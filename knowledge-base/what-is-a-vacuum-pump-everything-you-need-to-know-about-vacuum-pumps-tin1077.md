## 🔍 Definition of a Vacuum Pump
A **vacuum pump** is a device that removes gas molecules from a sealed volume in order to leave behind a partial vacuum. The main job of a vacuum pump is to generate a pressure lower than the atmospheric pressure in a specific system or space.



## 🛠 Common Types of Vacuum Pumps

Vacuum pumps are classified based on the pressure range they can achieve and their operating mechanism:

### 1. Positive Displacement Pumps
These use a mechanism to repeatedly expand a cavity, allow gases to flow in from the chamber, seal off the cavity, and exhaust it to the atmosphere.
* **Rotary Vane Pumps:** The most common type for deep vacuum applications.
* **Diaphragm Pumps:** Oil-free, ideal for chemical laboratories.

### 2. Momentum Transfer Pumps (Molecular Pumps)
High-speed jets of fluid or high-speed rotating blades knock gas molecules out of the chamber.
* **Diffusion Pumps:** Used for high vacuum in industrial processing.
* **Turbomolecular Pumps:** Essential for analytical instruments and semiconductor manufacturing.

### 3. Entrapment Pumps
These capture gases in a solid or adsorbed state. This includes **Cryopumps** which use cold temperatures to condense gases.

## 📏 Technical Selection Criteria
When choosing a vacuum pump, our engineers recommend evaluating:
* **Pumping Speed:** The volume flow rate of the pump (m³/h or CFM).
* **Ultimate Vacuum Level:** The lowest pressure the pump can reach (Pascal or mbar).
* **Gas Compatibility:** Whether the pump can handle corrosive or flammable gases.
* **Oil-free vs. Oil-sealed:** Depending on the cleanliness requirements of your application.
