## 📌 Definition: What is a Water Bath?
A **Laboratory Water Bath** is a heat-regulating equipment designed to incubate samples in water maintained at a constant temperature. Unlike direct heating methods (like Bunsen burners or hot plates), a water bath provides a uniform and gentle heat distribution, making it ideal for flammable chemicals, cell cultures, and biological reagents that are sensitive to thermal shock.

## 🛠️ Common Types of Laboratory Water Baths
Selecting the right configuration is essential for experimental accuracy. QTE Technologies categorizes these into three main types:

1.  **Circulating Water Baths (Stirred):** Feature a pump or stirrer to circulate water, ensuring maximum temperature uniformity. Best for high-precision requirements.
2.  **Non-Circulating Water Baths:** Rely on natural convection. These are cost-effective for general heating tasks where absolute uniformity is not critical.
3.  **Shaking Water Baths:** Combine heating with a reciprocating or orbital shaking motion. Ideal for microbiology and hybridization applications.

## 💡 Professional Operating Procedures

To maintain the high standards of QTE Technologies equipment, follow these technical protocols:

### 1. Water Quality & Filling
* Always use **Distilled or Deionized Water** to prevent mineral scale buildup on the heating elements.
* Ensure the water level is between the "Min" and "Max" indicators before powering on.

### 2. Temperature Calibration
* Power the unit on and set the target temperature via the digital PID controller.
* Allow the bath to stabilize (Equilibrium) for at least 15–30 minutes before placing samples inside.

### 3. Best Practices
* Use a **Gabled Lid** to prevent evaporation and maintain temperature stability, especially above 60°C.
* Periodically clean the tank with specialized stainless steel cleaners to prevent corrosion.

## ✅ Technical Selection Criteria
When sourcing from our **1 million+ product catalog**, prioritize these specifications:
* **Temperature Stability:** Standard models offer ±0.1°C to ±0.5°C.
* **Tank Construction:** Look for **Seamless Stainless Steel (SUS304)** to eliminate the risk of leaks at weld points.
* **Safety Features:** Over-temperature protection and low-liquid alarms are mandatory for 24/7 operations.
