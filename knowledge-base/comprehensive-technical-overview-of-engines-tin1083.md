## 🔍 Definition of an Engine/Motor
An **engine** or **motor** is a machine designed to convert one form of energy (such as electrical, chemical, or thermal energy) into mechanical energy to create motion. They serve as the "heart" of most mechanical systems, ranging from small laboratory instruments to massive industrial production lines.



## 🛠 Major Classifications of Engines

Engines are generally classified based on their energy source and operating principles:

### 1. Electric Motors
These convert electrical energy into mechanical energy and are the most prevalent in modern industry due to their high efficiency and clean operation.
* **DC Motors (Direct Current):** Ideal for precision control applications, such as robotics and small actuators.
* **AC Motors (Alternating Current):** Commonly found in high-power industrial pumps, fans, and air compressors.

### 2. Internal Combustion Engines (ICE)
These convert the chemical energy of fuel (petrol, diesel) into heat and then into mechanical energy.
* Typically used in mobile machinery, backup power generators, and heavy construction equipment.

### 3. Hydraulic and Pneumatic Motors
These utilize the pressure of liquids or gases to generate motion.
* Widely used in automation lines and lifting equipment requiring significant force.

## 📏 Technical Selection Criteria
When selecting or replacing a motor for industrial use, consider these key parameters:
* **Power Output (Watt/HP):** The work capacity of the engine.
* **Rotational Speed (RPM):** Revolutions per minute.
* **Torque:** The rotational force, determining the ability to move heavy loads.
* **Ingress Protection (IP Rating):** Resistance to dust and water in harsh industrial environments.
