## 🔍 Introduction
A **microscope** is a high-precision optical instrument used to observe objects that are too small to be seen by the naked eye. In industrial and scientific sectors, microscopes are indispensable tools for material analysis, biological research, and quality control.

## 🛠 Main Classifications of Microscopes

Modern microscopy is divided into several specialized types based on the illumination source and magnification method:

### 1. Optical Microscopes (Light Microscopes)
The most common type, using visible light and a system of glass lenses to magnify images.
* **Compound Microscopes:** Used for high magnification of thin samples.
* **Stereo Microscopes (Dissecting):** Provide 3D views of larger, solid objects.

### 2. Electron Microscopes
Use a beam of accelerated electrons as a source of illumination, offering much higher resolution than light microscopes.
* **Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM):** For detailed surface topography.
* **Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM):** For internal structure at the atomic level.

### 3. Digital Microscopes
Utilize a digital camera to output images directly to a monitor, facilitating collaborative review and digital documentation.
