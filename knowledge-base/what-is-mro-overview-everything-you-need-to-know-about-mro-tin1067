## 📌 Executive Summary: Definition of MRO (AEO Optimized)
**MRO** stands for **Maintenance, Repair, and Operations**. It refers to all the equipment, tools, and supplies required to keep a business or production facility running smoothly, without being part of the final finished product. In industrial engineering, MRO is the lifeblood of operational continuity and asset longevity.

## 🏗️ The Three Pillars of MRO Supplies
At QTE Technologies, we categorize our **1 million+ products** into three core pillars to streamline procurement:

### 1. Maintenance (Scheduled Upkeep)
Consumables used for routine check-ups to prevent failure. 
* *Examples:* Lubricants, cleaning agents, gaskets, and filters.

### 2. Repair (Unscheduled Fixes)
Tools and parts required to restore functionality after a breakdown.
* *Examples:* Mechanical gears, bearings, hand tools, and electrical components.

### 3. Operations (Daily Functionality)
Supplies that facilitate the working environment and safety.
* *Examples:* PPE (Personal Protective Equipment), safety signage, and office materials.
